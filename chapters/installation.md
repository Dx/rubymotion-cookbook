# Installation

I am assuming you already have a mac with OSX Lion and App Store installed.

Open the app store, search for xcode, click on it, it is a free app , download it.


## Xcode Install

This is a huge file about 1.5GB, so you need to a good connection and have enough time to download in a single stretch. Make sure you have couple of GB's of free space.

Xcode gets installed in /Developer in your hard disk/SSD.

For running the app built by you on device you would need a Apple developer account, I would add the instructions at a later time.


## RubyMotion install
Ruby comes preinstalled in OSX Lion, open terminal and check the version.

    $ ruby -v
	ruby 1.8.7 (2010-01-10 patchlevel 249) [universal-darwin11.0]

If you are a advanced user you can get [RVM](https://rvm.io/) and install a custom ruby version.

Goto [RubyMotion site](rubymotion.com) and click on the [buy link](http://sites.fastspring.com/hipbyte/product/rubymotion) and buy your RubyMotion License.

Rates as on 9th May is 149$ it is a early bird rate so hurry.

Download the installer [http://www.rubymotion.com/files/RubyMotion%20Installer.zip](http://www.rubymotion.com/files/RubyMotion%20Installer.zip) .

Please have your license code ready as it asks at this stage.

Open the zip file and run the installer.

Accept the terms and conditions, enter the license key and begin install, you would be prompted for your system password, once that is done in couple of seconds the install would complete and you are ready to work with RubyMotion.
