## Official intro screencast

(http://www.youtube.com/user/hipbyte)[http://www.youtube.com/user/hipbyte] on this Youtube channel you can find 2 interesting videos and hope there would be more videos published in coming days.

[RubyMotion: Interactive Console Demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rejYKzLglSE) 1:09

Interctive Console/REPL is the killer feature which makes it worth diving into RubyMotion.
