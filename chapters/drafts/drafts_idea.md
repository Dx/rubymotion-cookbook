# Best Practices
RubyMotion is still evolving, but based on my personal opinion these are the guidelines



* new projects created by RubyMotion does not have any files in resources folder and under git empty folders are versioned, so please do add .gitkeep (ruby on rails style) files


* if rake is not going to read your rvm configuration and you are not going to use bundle exec, there is no reason to add .rvmrc file to rubymotion project
