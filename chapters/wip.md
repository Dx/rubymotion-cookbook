# Work in Progress

I am also doing some consulting gigs on RubyMotion, and using that experience to write the book, so sorry for no update for last 2 weeks. I have removed the blank pages in the build for now. so don't have to worry about the structure of the book before it is written. thinking of getting a co-author as well if you are interested mail me ( senthil at railsfactory dot com ) .
